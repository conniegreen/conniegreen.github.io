    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I feel like i can&rsquo;t call this &ldquo;My blog&rdquo; if it looks just like every other <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a> blog, and since this project started with educational purposes, i decided that instead of basing my theme on the default one, or even on one of the many <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">3rd party themes</a> out there, i would make my own from scratch.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I decided to use some of the tools that i learned about while getting Octopress running, like <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> (<a href="http://www.sassnotsass.com/">not SASS</a>). But of course my short attention span wouldn&rsquo;t let me just go ahead and read on those and get on with the project so i ended up adding <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy</a> and <a href="http://breakpoint-sass.com/">Breakpoint</a> into the mix, but this brought a little problem</p>

<pre><code>Unable to activate breakpoint-2.4.2, because sass-3.2.19 conflicts with sass &lt;~&gt; 3.3.0
</code></pre>

<p>This lead me to use and learn about <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> as recommended by <a href="https://github.com/Team-Sass/breakpoint/wiki/Installation#requirements">Breakpoint&rsquo;s wiki</a>, i knew some about this as <strong>bundle install</strong> is required by Octopress, but at the time, i didn&rsquo;t really know what that did.</p>

<p>So basically what Bundler does, is get&rsquo;s a list of gems, like Compass or Sass for example, from a <a href="http://bundler.io/v1.6/gemfile.html">Gemfile</a> in your project and installs them, but what&rsquo;s more important, you can specify what version do you want installed, and Bundler makes sure your project uses those versions so you can make sure there&rsquo;s no conflicts.</p>

<p>For my theme what i did was go to <a href="https://rubygems.org">https://rubygems.org</a> and check the gems i needed, version, dependencies and all that and ended up with this.</p>

<pre><code>source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'sass', '~&gt; 3.3.9'
gem 'compass', '~&gt; 1.0.0.alpha.19'
gem 'compass-normalize', '~&gt; 1.5'
gem 'susy', '~&gt; 2.1.2'
gem 'breakpoint', '~&gt; 2.4.2'
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure <em>1.0.0.alpha.19</em> should be used, since it&rsquo;s it an alpha version and it&rsquo;s probably buggy, but i&rsquo;m still learning, and this is the fix i found.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep on working on the theme and see where it leads me, and hopefully i&rsquo;ll finish it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This (the blog you are reading right now) is finally working! It started as a way to test <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> but i guess since it&rsquo;s up, i might as well use it by documenting what i got wrong and how i fixed it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>If you haven&rsquo;t figured out yet, i&rsquo;m using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octropress</a> which makes it easy get the page set with a few commands on the terminal, except of course when things don&rsquo;t work as intended, and it can happen often when you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing, like myself.</p>

<p>My very first issue was with bundler:</p>

<pre><code>Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/.......
Fetching additional metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
Using rake 10.3.2

Gem::Installer::ExtensionBuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

        /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 extconf.rb
/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require': cannot load such file -- mkmf (LoadError)
        from /usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require'
        from extconf.rb:1:in `&lt;main&gt;'


Gem files will remain installed in /home/green/dev/octopress/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/RedCloth-4.2.9 for inspection.
Results logged to /home/green/dev/octopress/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/RedCloth-4.2.9/ext/redcloth_scan/gem_make.out
An error occurred while installing RedCloth (4.2.9), and Bundler cannot
continue.
Make sure that `gem install RedCloth -v '4.2.9'` succeeds before bundling.
</code></pre>

<p>so i did what i always do, i googled, and i ended up where i always end, Stackoverflow, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14353864">this</a> fixed my problem, not the whole thing but</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-full 
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit sad not knowing exactly why, but happy that it worked, the rest was just following Octopress' <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">docs</a> and the blog was up and running.</p>

<p>Next step is building my own theme, but that is left for another post.</p>
