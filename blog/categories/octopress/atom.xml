    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This (the blog you are reading right now) is finally working! It started as a way to test <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> but i guess since it&rsquo;s up, i might as well use it by documenting what i got wrong and how i fixed it.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t figured out yet, i&rsquo;m using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octropress</a> which makes it easy get the page set with a few commands on the terminal, except of course when things don&rsquo;t work as intended, and it can happen often when you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing, like myself.</p>

<p>My very first issue was with bundler:</p>

<pre><code>Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/.......
Fetching additional metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
Using rake 10.3.2

Gem::Installer::ExtensionBuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

        /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 extconf.rb
/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require': cannot load such file -- mkmf (LoadError)
        from /usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require'
        from extconf.rb:1:in `&lt;main&gt;'


Gem files will remain installed in /home/green/dev/octopress/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/RedCloth-4.2.9 for inspection.
Results logged to /home/green/dev/octopress/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/RedCloth-4.2.9/ext/redcloth_scan/gem_make.out
An error occurred while installing RedCloth (4.2.9), and Bundler cannot
continue.
Make sure that `gem install RedCloth -v '4.2.9'` succeeds before bundling.

<p>so i did what i always do, i googled, and i ended up where i always end, Stackoverflow, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14353864">this</a> fixed my problem, not the whole thing but</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-full 
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit sad not knowing exactly why, but happy that it worked, the rest was just following Octopress' <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">docs</a> and the blog was up and running.</p>

<p>Next step is building my own theme, but that is left for another post.</p>
