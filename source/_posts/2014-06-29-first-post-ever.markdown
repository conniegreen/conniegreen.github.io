I decided to give it a try, i told myself i never would, but i ended up writing a blog anyway. Yes, sure, it probably doesn't look like much but it's definitely a starting point, besides, the main point of this project wasn't actually to write a blog, but to try new things, like in this case Octopress hosted on Github Pages.

So far it seems to be working but there's a lot of room improvement, i'll update this with a TODO list, or something of the sort.
